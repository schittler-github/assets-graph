## Project details
The aim of this project is to showcase how graph-databases can be used to analyse a list of assests and their owners.

This project is divided into three main parts: 
1. first is the synthetic data generation;
2. second is the translation of the resulting list (data generation) into a graph-database;
3. is the analysis in itself.
