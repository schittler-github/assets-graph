## Project details
The aim of this project is to showcase how graph-databases can be used to analyse a list of assests and their owners.

This project is divided into three main parts: 
1. first is the synthetic data generation;
2. second is the translation of the resulting list (data generation) into a graph-database;
3. is the analysis in itself.

The data generation is done in python via a jupyter Lab project
The analysis of the data is done via Griemlin; 

**To run this project** you will need: **Jupyter Lab** and  **Griemlin** on your machine. A variation of this project will be later ported to Azure, for demonstrating another workflow.
